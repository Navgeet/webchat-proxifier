This is the freenode webchat proxifier from http://sed.free.fr/freenode/.
It relays webchat though localhost/6667 which makes it trivial to connect
to webchat through any client or telnet.
As of now its a hack hardcoded to work with Freenode. However it should be
able to work with all networks using qwebirc.

If you get SSL certificate errors, recompile replacing https with http.
